# Who Kidnapped Mother Goose?

By Garry Francis

## Background

You feel your brain rattling around inside your head. Someone is shaking you.

"Wake up! Wake up!"

You rub your eyes and squint in the bright morning sunlight. You vaguely make out the silhouette of your next-door neighbour, Peter the pumpkin eater.

"Mother Goose has been kidnapped!"

That catches your attention. You spring out of bed. Mother Goose is your other next-door neighbour and a dear friend. Once Peter sees that you're out of bed, he quickly loses interest in the emergency and goes to tend to his vegetable garden. You, however, must rescue Mother Goose!

This is a traditional text adventure that was written for [Text Adventure Literacy Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/talp2024), 1 March to 30 April 2024. The game is hosted at [Who Kidnapped Mother Goose?](https://warrigal.itch.io/who-kidnapped-mother-goose).
