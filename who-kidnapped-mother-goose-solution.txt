Solution by Garry Francis
----------------------------------------
This is a minimal solution. You'll need to EXAMINE lots of things for this solution to make sense. Also make sure you TALK TO any non-player characters that you come across and ASK <character> ABOUT anything that seems relevant or anything they mention that may be of interest.

Some optional (but significant) commands are shown in parentheses. These may be omitted once you know what to do.
